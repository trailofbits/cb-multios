const char cgc_text[] = "It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, " \
"or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads and " \
"cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, " \
"four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for " \
"an alms. These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest " \
"livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg " \
"sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn " \
"thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight " \
"for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes. " \
"I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of " \
"children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, " \
"and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of " \
"the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever " \
"could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children " \
"sound and useful members of the common-wealth, would deserve so well of " \
"the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation. " \
"But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the " \
"children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall " \
"take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of " \
"parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand " \
"our charity in the streets. " \
"As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years, upon this " \
"important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of " \
"our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their " \
"computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be " \
"supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment: " \
"at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may " \
"certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of " \
"begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for " \
"them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents, " \
"or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives, " \
"they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to " \
"the cloathing of many thousands. " \
"There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will " \
"prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of " \
"women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us, " \
"sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence " \
"than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and " \
"inhuman breast. " \
"The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million " \
"and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand " \
"couple whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty " \
"thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although " \
"I apprehend there cannot be so many, under the present distresses of " \
"the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and " \
"seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those " \
"women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within " \
"the year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of " \
"poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number " \
"shall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already said, under " \
"the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the " \
"methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft " \
"or agriculture; we neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor " \
"cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing " \
"till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly " \
"parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier; " \
"during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as " \
"probationers: As I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the " \
"county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or " \
"two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so " \
"renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art. " \
"I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years " \
"old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they " \
"will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown " \
"at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the " \
"parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at " \
"least four times that value. " \
"I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will " \
"not be liable to the least objection. " \
"I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in " \
"London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a " \
"most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, " \
"baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a " \
"fricasie, or a ragoust. " \
"I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the " \
"hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand " \
"may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; " \
"which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my " \
"reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a " \
"circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will " \
"be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand " \
"may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and " \
"fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them " \
"suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat " \
"for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for " \
"friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will " \
"make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will " \
"be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter. " \
"I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12 " \
"pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28 " \
"pounds. " \
"I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for " \
"landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem " \
"to have the best title to the children. " \
"Infant's flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful " \
"in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave " \
"author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet, " \
"there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine " \
"months after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because " \
"the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom, " \
"and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening " \
"the number of Papists among us. " \
"I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which " \
"list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers) " \
"to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no " \
"gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good " \
"fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent " \
"nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his " \
"own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a good " \
"landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight " \
"shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces another " \
"child. " \
"Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may " \
"flea the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make " \
"admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen. " \
"As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in " \
"the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not " \
"be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and " \
"dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs. " \
"A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues " \
"I highly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this matter, to " \
"offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this " \
"kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the " \
"want of venison might be well supply'd by the bodies of young lads and " \
"maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so great " \
"a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for " \
"want of work and service: And these to be disposed of by their parents " \
"if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due " \
"deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I " \
"cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American " \
"acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was " \
"generally tough and lean, like that of our school-boys, by continual " \
"exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not " \
"answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with " \
"humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon would " \
"become breeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some " \
"scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although " \
"indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I " \
"confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any " \
"project, how well soever intended. " \
"But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient " \
"was put into his head by the famous Salmanaazor, a native of the island " \
"Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago, and in " \
"conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young person " \
"happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to persons " \
"of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a " \
"plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the " \
"Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty's prime minister of state, and " \
"other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet, at four " \
"hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same use were " \
"made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one single " \
"groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear " \
"at a play-house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will " \
"pay for; the kingdom would not be the worse. " \
"Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast " \
"number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have " \
"been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease " \
"the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain " \
"upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day " \
"dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast " \
"as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they " \
"are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and " \
"consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a degree, that if " \
"at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not " \
"strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are happily " \
"delivered from the evils to come. " \
"I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I " \
"think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and " \
"many, as well as of the highest importance. " \
"For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the " \
"number of Papists, with whom we are yearly over-run, being the principal " \
"breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who " \
"stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the " \
"Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good " \
"Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at " \
"home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate. " \
"Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own, " \
"which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their " \
"landlord's rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a " \
"thing unknown. " \
"Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of an hundred thousand children, " \
"from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than " \
"ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby " \
"encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a " \
"new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the " \
"kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate " \
"among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and " \
"manufacture. " \
"Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings " \
"sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the " \
"charge of maintaining them after the first year. " \
"Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, " \
"where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best " \
"receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their " \
"houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves " \
"upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands " \
"how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they " \
"please. " \
"Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise " \
"nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and " \
"penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards " \
"their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the " \
"poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual profit " \
"instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among the " \
"married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the " \
"market. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of " \
"their pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in " \
"calf, or sow when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick " \
"them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage. " \
"Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition " \
"of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel'd beef: the " \
"propagation of swine's flesh, and improvement in the art of making good " \
"bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, " \
"too frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or " \
"magnificence to a well grown, fat yearly child, which roasted whole will " \
"make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other publick " \
"entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being studious of " \
"brevity. " \
"Supposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant " \
"customers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry " \
"meetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that " \
"Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the " \
"rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper) " \
"the remaining eighty thousand. " \
"I can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against " \
"this proposal, unless it should be urged, that the number of people will " \
"be thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and 'twas " \
"indeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire the " \
"reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one individual " \
"Kingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or, I think, " \
"ever can be upon Earth. Therefore let no man talk to me of other " \
"expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using " \
"neither cloaths, nor houshold furniture, except what is of our " \
"own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and " \
"instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of " \
"pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein " \
"of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our " \
"country, wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants " \
"of Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any " \
"longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment " \
"their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country " \
"and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one " \
"degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of " \
"honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution " \
"could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite " \
"to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, " \
"nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, " \
"though often and earnestly invited to it. " \
"Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like " \
"expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will " \
"ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice. " \
"But, as to my self, having been wearied out for many years with offering " \
"vain, idle, visionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of " \
"success, I fortunately fell upon this proposal, which, as it is wholly " \
"new, so it hath something solid and real, of no expence and little " \
"trouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger " \
"in disobliging England. For this kind of commodity will not bear " \
"exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a " \
"long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country, which " \
"would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it. " \
"After all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject " \
"any offer, proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent, " \
"cheap, easy, and effectual. But before something of that kind shall be " \
"advanced in contradiction to my scheme, and offering a better, I desire " \
"the author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points. " \
"First, As things now stand, how they will be able to find food and " \
"raiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly, " \
"There being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout " \
"this kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock, would " \
"leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling, adding those who are " \
"beggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers, " \
"with their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire " \
"those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold " \
"to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these " \
"mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness " \
"to have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe, and " \
"thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they have " \
"since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the impossibility of " \
"paying rent without money or trade, the want of common sustenance, with " \
"neither house nor cloaths to cover them from the inclemencies of the " \
"weather, and the most inevitable prospect of intailing the like, or " \
"greater miseries, upon their breed for ever. " \
"I profess, in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least " \
"personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work, having " \
"no other motive than the publick good of my country, by advancing " \
"our trade, providing for infants, relieving the poor, and giving some " \
"pleasure to the rich. I have no children, by which I can propose to " \
"get a single penny; the youngest being nine years old, and my wife past " \
"child-bearing. ";
