This machine will generate a *lot* of povs; however, some of them don't work due to the heap layout (which we still try to make as friendly as possible).
Due to the large number of possible PoVs, we instead limit ourselves to probing a sampling of those available.
This should provide reasonable assurance as to whether the vulnerabilities have been patched or not.

New PoVs can be filtered with the following one-liner:
for i in `ls *.xml`; do if [ -z "`cb-test --xml $i --directory ../bin/ --cb NRFIN_00032 --should_core 2>&1 | grep 'signal 11'`" ]; then mv $i bad/; fi; done
