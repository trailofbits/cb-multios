## Description

Multipass is a new, magical, way to pay for all of life's necessities. Simply swipe and go for gas, food, vending machines, and at conbinis! 

### Feature List

The following transactions are available:
- Make purchase (use multi-pass card to make a purchase from a vendor)
- Refund purchase (use multi-pass card to refund a previous purchase)
- Balance inquiry (use multi-pass card to query its balance)
- List transaction history (use multi-pass card to query the list of recent transactions)
- Issue new Multi-Pass (request a new multi-pass card)
- Add funds to Multi-Pass (use multi-pass card to add funds to the balance)

## Vulnerability

This multipass daemon has a few internal structures to track if a transaction is open/closed. Upon finalizing a transaction its open flag should be set to zero.
The vulnerable version, however, decrements the is_open flag (account.c:205) such that it rolls over to +128 (char var). This offset is used directly as an cgc_ERRNO.
The NULL dereference is not triggered immediately, the system waits until it has to generate an error message packet (multipass.c:generate_error). 
In the error generation process, the cgc_ERRNO is used as an offset into a table of char * pointers (multipass.h:104). The index is out of bounds in this array of char pointers and causes a null dereference.

Another simpler NULL dereference involves invoking refund operation against a non-refundable transaction. Specifically, all AUTH requests are logged to the MULTIPASS history. AUTH transaction histories do not contain a data section. One of the first steps in the refund operation is to lookup a transaction by ID and dereference the data section. Dereferencing the null data section of an AUTH transaction leads to another NULL pointer dereference. 

### Generic class of vulnerability

Integer underflow followed by NULL dereference.

Plain null dereference.

### CWE classification

NULL Pointer Dereference
CWE-476

## Challenges
* The release poller does not include any information about how to generate error messages.
* The CRS requires taint tracking across a static variable which is touched in a fair amount of the program, this might be optimized away by some competitors.
* The release poller is not indicative of the protocol allowing *multiple* FINS.
