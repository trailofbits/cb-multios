/*
 The MULTIPASS PROTOCOL is used to process the operations of a multi-use
 RFID payment card (i.e. Multi-pass) and record them in a transaction log.
 It can also issue new multi-pass cards.


** Operations **
 There are 6 types of multi-pass operations:

	typedef enum {
		PURCHASE = 0,	// 0
		RECHARGE,		// 1
		BALANCE,		// 2
		HISTORY,		// 3
		ISSUE,			// 4
		REFUND			// 5
	} OP_CODE;

 - PURCHASE: multi-pass is used at a vendor to make a purchase.
 - RECHARGE: multi-pass is used at a vendor to add money to the card balance.
 - BALANCE: multi-pass is used to query its balance.
 - HISTORY: multi-pass is used to query its last N transactions.
 - ISSUE: a new multi-pass card is issued with a given starting balance.
 - REFUND: multi-pass is used to cancel a purchase and refund the payment 
 	amount to the card's balance. The original purchase transaction is removed from
 	the server's transaction log.

 Each operation type involves a sequence of packets. 
	* Types of Packets *
	typedef enum {
		INIT = 0,	// 0
		AUTH,		// 1
		OPS,		// 2
		FIN 		// 3
	} PKT_TYPE;

 * Packet Sequence Overview *
 For all operations, except ISSUE:
 1. The first packet is of type AUTH. The server uses this packet to verify that
 the card_id / auth_code are on record and if so, to start a new transaction log entry and mark
 the transaction as 'AUTH'.
 2. The second packet is of type OPS. If a previous AUTH was completed for the 
 given transaction ID and card (ID/auth_code),
 the server uses this packet to perform the given operation and mark the transaction as operation 'OPS'.
 3. The final packet is of type FIN. If a previous OPS was completed for the 
 given transaction ID and card (ID/auth_code),
 the server uses this packet to mark the transaction as complete 'FIN'.

 For the ISSUE operation, it cannot AUTH since AUTH requires a valid card.
 And the purpose of ISSUE is to issue a new multi-pass card.
 1. The first packet is of type INIT. The server uses this packet to create a new card using
 the next card id, the next auth_code, and the client-provided inital balance. It also
 starts a new transaction log marked as 'INIT'.
 2. The final packet is of type FIN. If a previous INIT was completed for the 
 given transaction ID and card (ID/auth_code), 
 the server uses this packet to mark the transaction as complete 'FIN'.

** Transactions **

	FIRST_TRANSACTION_ID	= 191919

	* Transaction Record *
		OP_CODE op_code : 8;
		PKT_TYPE state : 8;
		STATUS status : 8;
		uint32_t card_id;
		uint32_t transaction_id;
		<Purchase|Balance|Issue|Recharge|Refund|History Data>;
		<Vendor Data if Purchase or Recharge Data in this transaction>

 Each operation results in a transaction record. 
 - The first transaction record has TRANSACTION_ID = FIRST_TRANSACTION_ID. 
 - Each subsequent record has TRANSACTION_ID = LATEST_TRANSACTION_ID + 1.
 - Each transaction record includes details for each operation.

** Multi-pass cards **

	FIRST_CARD_ID 			= 223344
	FIRST_CARD_AUTH_CODE	= 114466

	* Card Record *
		uint32_t card_id;
		uint32_t auth_code;
		uint32_t balance;

 The server issues and tracks Multi-pass cards, card authentication
 codes, and card balances.
 - The first multi-pass card has CARD_ID = FIRST_CARD_ID.
 - Each subsequent card has CARD_ID = LATEST_CARD_ID + 1.

 - The first card has AUTH_CODE = FIRST_CARD_AUTH_CODE.
 - Each subsequent card has LATEST_CARD_AUTH_CODE + 1.

 - The initial balance of a new card is provided by the client.

** Vendors **
 The PURCHASE and REFUND operations include vendor information.
 There are 7 valid types of vendors.
	* Types of Vendors *
	typedef enum {
		TRANSIT = 0,	// 0
		VENDING,		// 1
		CONVENIENCE,	// 2
		RESTAURANT,		// 3
		GAS,			// 4
		MOVIE,			// 5
		CAR 			// 6
	} VENDOR_TYPE;

 For each operation/transaction involving a vendor, the vendors'
 data is included.

	* Vendor Data *
	typedef struct vendor {
		uint32_t vendor_id;			
		VENDOR_TYPE vendor_type : 8;
		uint8_t vendor_location_sz;
		char * vendor_location;
	} vendor_t;

** Errors **
 Any errors in the server will cause the server to send to the client:
 1. Common Packet Header with status set to the error status value.
 2. Error Data with the message associated with error status value.
 3. Then the server will cgc_exit.

	* Error status codes *
	// this enum is used as 1 byte (0-255)
	typedef enum {
		OK = 0,
		ERRNO_MP_LIST_PUSH,		// Failed to add node to list
		ERRNO_MP_LIST_RM,		// Failed to rm node from list
		ERRNO_MP_ALLOC,			// Failed to allocate memory
		ERRNO_MP_DEALLOC,		// Failed to deallocate memory
		ERRNO_MP_PURCHASE_ISF,		// Insufficient Funds
		ERRNO_MP_RECHARGE_FULL,	// Recharge would case card balance to wrap
		ERRNO_MP_REFUND_FULL,	// Refund would cause card balance to wrap
		ERRNO_MP_NO_HISTORY,	// No matching transaction history in transaction list.
		ERRNO_MP_INVALID_OPCODE,	// Invalid Op_code
		ERRNO_MP_INVALID_P_TYPE,	// Invalid Packet Type
		ERRNO_MP_INVALID_V_TYPE,	// Invalid Vendor Type
		ERRNO_MP_NO_AUTH,		// Transaction did not complete AUTH step
		ERRNO_MP_NO_INIT,		// Transaction did not complete INIT step
		ERRNO_MP_NO_OPS,		// Transaction did not complete OPS step
		ERRNO_MP_NOT_FOUND,		// When the card or transaction is not in the list
		ERRNO_MP_INVALID_CARD,	// Card does not exist or is invalid
		ERRNO_MP_RECV,			// Failed to receive expected number of bytes
		ERRNO_MP_UNK			// Unknown error
	} STATUS;

	* Error Messages *
	// status -> message
	ERRNO_MP_LIST_PUSH 		-> "Failed to extend list."
	ERRNO_MP_LIST_RM 		-> "Failed to remove node from list."
	ERRNO_MP_ALLOC 			-> "Failed to allocate memory."
	ERRNO_MP_DEALLOC		-> "Failed to deallocate memory."
	ERRNO_MP_PURCHASE_ISF	-> "Insuffient funds for purchase."
	ERRNO_MP_RECHARGE_FULL	-> "Unable to recharge card. Balance near max."
	ERRNO_MP_REFUND_FULL	-> "Unable to refund card. Balance near max."
	ERRNO_MP_NO_HISTORY		-> "No matching transaction history."
	ERRNO_MP_INVALID_OPCODE	-> "Invalid OP_CODE."
	ERRNO_MP_INVALID_P_TYPE	-> "Invalid PKT_TYPE."
	ERRNO_MP_INVALID_V_TYPE	-> "Invalid VENDOR_TYPE."
	ERRNO_MP_NO_AUTH		-> "Transaction has not completed AUTH."
	ERRNO_MP_NO_INIT		-> "Transaction has not completed INIT."
	ERRNO_MP_NO_OPS			-> "Transaction has not completed OPS."
